Back in September of 2021 3 friends (Michael, Anthony, and Cameron) proposed the idea of creating a version of the TV show Taskmaster, but with some of their other friends. And as part of a live event for a holiday party they were having in December 2021.

This is the edited version of the live show which took place December 26th.

All of this was done for fun and for free during our free times. We hope you enjoy it!
