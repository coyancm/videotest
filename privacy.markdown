              <a id="section_01" style="text-decoration:none"><h5>What information do I collect?</h5></a>
                <h6><span class="subheader">Personal information you voluntarily disclose to me</span></h6>
                <p><strong>Plain language: </strong><i>When you voluntarily provide your personal information to me in order to contact me or work with me, I keep that personal information so I can contact you or work with you. I keep this information for as long as we work together. This information is usually your name and contact information. I don't keep any personal information I don't need.</i></p>
                <p>I collect personal information that you voluntarily provide when you express an interest in obtaining information about me or my products and Services, when you participate in activities on the Website, or otherwise when you contact me.</p>
                <p>The personal information that I collect depends on the context of your interactions with me and the Website, the choices you make, and the products and features you use. The personal information I collect may include the following:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li><strong>Personal Information Provided by You.</strong> I collect names, email addresses, and other similar information.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Just like how the personal information I provide to you must be true, complete, accurate, all personal information that you provide to me must be true, complete, and accurate, and you must notify me of any changes to such personal information.</p>
                <h6><span class="subheader">Information automatically collected</span></h6>
                <p><strong>Plain language: </strong><i>Some information — such as your Internet Protocol (IP) address and/or browser and device characteristics — is collected automatically when you visit my Website. Because I am an individual, I use Google Analytics to know when visitors are going to my Website and what pages they go to. Google Analytics does not disclose any information such as name or contact information. I collect this information only to weed out malicious traffic, determine roughly where the majority of my contacts are located so I can cater my services to fit regional needs, and find out if my site is working or not.</i></p>
                <p>I automatically collect certain information when you visit, use, or navigate through the Website. This information does not reveal your specific identity (like your name or contact information) but may include device and usage information, such as your IP address, browser and device characteristics, operating system, language preferences, referring URLs, device name, country, location, information about how and when you use my Website, and other technical information. This information is primarily needed to maintain the security and operation of my Website and for my internal analytics and reporting purposes.</p>
                <p>Like many businesses, I also collect information through cookies and similar technologies. The information I collect through cookies includes:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li><strong>Log and Usage Data.</strong> Log and usage data is service-related, diagnostic, usage, and performance information my servers automatically collect when you access or use my Website and which I record in log files. Depending on how you interact with me, this log data may include your IP address, device information, browser type and settings, and information about your activity on the Website (such as the date/time stamps associated with your usage, pages and files viewed, searches, and other actions you take such as which features you use), device event information (such as system activity, error reports (sometimes called 'crash dumps'), and hardware settings).</li>
                  <li><strong>Device Data.</strong> I collect device data such as information about your computer, phone, tablet, or other device you use to access the Website. Depending on the device used, this device data may include information such as your IP address (or proxy server), device and application identification numbers, location, browser type, hardware model, Internet service provider and/or mobile carrier, operating system, and system configuration information.</li>
                  <li><strong>Location Data.</strong> I collect location data such as information about your device's location, which can be either precise or imprecise. How much information I collect depends on the type and settings of the device you use to access the Website. For example, GPS and other technologies collects geolocation data that tells me your current location (based on your IP address). You can opt out of allowing me to collect this information either by refusing access to the information or by disabling your Location setting on your device. Note however, if you choose to opt out, you may not be able to use certain aspects of your device Services.</li>
                </ul>
                
<a id="section_02" style="text-decoration:none"><h5>How do I use your information?</h5></a>
                <p><strong>Plain language: </strong><i>I process your information only for legitimate business interests, the fulfillment of my contract with you, compliance with my legal obligations, and with your consent.</i></p>
                <p>I use personal information collected via my Website for a variety of business purposes described below.

                  <li><strong>To respond to legal requests and prevent harm.</strong> If I receive a subpoena or other legal request, I may need to inspect the data I hold to determine how to respond.</li>
                  <li><strong>Fulfill and manage your orders.</strong> I may use your information to fulfill and manage your orders, payments, returns, and exchanges.</li>

<a id="section_03" style="text-decoration:none"><h5>Will your information be shared with anyone?</h5></a>
                <p><strong>Plain language: </strong><i>I only share information with your consent and to comply with laws, to provide you with services, to protect your rights, or to fulfill business obligations.</i></p>
                <p>I may process or share your data that I hold based on the following legal basis:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li><strong>Consent:</strong> I may process your data if you have given me specific consent to use your personal information for a specific purpose. For example (but not limited to), providing your contact information so I may contact you.</li>
                  <li><strong>Legitimate Interests:</strong> I may process your data when it is reasonably necessary to achieve my legitimate business interests. For example (but not limited to), providing your business address for contract or payment processing purposes.</li>
                  <li><strong>Performance of a Contract:</strong> Where I have entered into a contract with you, I may process your personal information to fulfill the terms of our contract. For example (but not limited to), providing deliverables for review or final submission.</li>
                  <li><strong>Legal Obligations:</strong> I may disclose your information where I am legally required to do so in order to comply with applicable law, governmental requests, a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process, such as in response to a court order or a subpoena (including in response to public authorities to meet national security or law enforcement requirements).</li>
                  <li><strong>Vital Interests:</strong> I may disclose your information where I believe it is necessary to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding potential violations of our policies, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the safety of any person and illegal activities, or as evidence in litigation in which we are involved.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>I may also need to process your data or share your personal information for business transfers. I may share or transfer your information in connection with, or during negotiations of, any merger, sale of company assets, financing, or acquisition of all or a portion of my business to another company. I may also share or transfer your information to your selected individual or business in the event you decide to transfer your request to another individual or business.</p>
                <p>I have not disclosed or sold any personal information to third parties for a business or commercial purpose in the preceding 12 months. I also will never sell personal information in the future belonging to website visitors, users and other consumers.</p>
                
<a id="section_04" style="text-decoration:none"><h5>Do I use cookies and other tracking technologies?</h5></a>
                <p><strong>Plain language: </strong><i>I may use cookies and other tracking technologies to collect and store your information.</i></p>
                <p>I may use cookies and similar tracking technologies (like web beacons and pixels) to access or store information. I use Google Analytics to collect basic information on visitors to my site, including device type, operating system, and browser type. I do not collect personal information like name, specific location, or contact information with these cookies. These cookies help me learn when users are accessing my site, how many users access my site, what pages are most popular on my site, and whether or not traffic to my site is malicious. I do not store any personal information about any visitors to my site without your permission.</p>
                
<a id="section_05" style="text-decoration:none"><h5>How long do I keep your information?</h5></a>
                <p><strong>Plain language: </strong><i>I keep your information for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this privacy notice unless otherwise required by law. For example, I keep your information you provide while we conduct business, so I can contact you regarding services you want to receive (i.e. deliverables, direct communication, and payment transactions).</i></p>
                <p>I will only keep your personal information for as long as it is necessary for the purposes set out in this privacy notice, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law (such as tax, accounting, or other legal requirements). No purpose in this notice will require me keeping your personal information for longer than 1 year.</p>
                <p>When I have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, I will either delete or anonymize such information, or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then I will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.</p>
                
<a id="section_06" style="text-decoration:none"><h5>How do I keep your information safe?</h5></a>
                <p><strong>Plain language: </strong><i>I protect your personal information through a system of organizational and technical security measures. Your information is also never given to anyone else without your permission. I do not trade, sell, or distribute your information to other individuals, businesses, or other third parties.</i></p>
                <p>I have implemented appropriate technical and organizational security measures designed to protect the security of any personal information I process. However, despite my safeguards and efforts to secure your information, no electronic transmission over the Internet or information storage technology can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, so I cannot promise or guarantee that hackers, cybercriminals, or other unauthorized third parties will not be able to defeat my security, and improperly collect, access, steal, or modify your information. Although I will do my best to protect your personal information, transmission of personal information to and from my Website is at your own risk. You should only access the Website within a secure environment.</p>
                
<a id="section_07" style="text-decoration:none"><h5>Do I collect information from minors?</h5></a>
                <p><strong>Plain language: </strong><i>I do not knowingly collect data from or market to children under 18 years of age. My Website and its services are not catered to or marketed toward children under 18 years of age.</i></p>
                <p>I do not knowingly solicit data from or market to children under 18 years of age. By using the Website, you represent that you are at least 18 or that you are the parent or guardian of such a minor and consent to such minor dependent’s use of the Website. If I learn that personal information from users less than 18 years of age has been collected, I will cease any business transactions and take reasonable measures to promptly delete such data from my records. If you become aware of any data I may have collected from children under age 18, please contact me at <a href="mailto:coyancm@gmail.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">coyancm@gmail.com</a> right away.</p>
                
<a id="section_08" style="text-decoration:none"><h5>What are your privacy rights?</h5></a>
                <p><strong>Plain language: </strong><i>Everyone has a right to privacy. You may review, change, or request to delete your personal data I have collected from you at any time.</i></p>
                <p>If you are a resident in the EEA or UK and you believe I am unlawfully processing your personal information, you also have the right to complain to your local data protection supervisory authority. You can find their contact details here: <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/bodies/authorities/index_en.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">https://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/bodies/authorities/index_en.htm</a>.</p>

                <h6><span class="subheader">Cookies and similar technologies</span></h6>
                <p>Most Web browsers are set to accept cookies by default. If you prefer, you can usually choose to set your browser to remove cookies and to reject cookies. If you choose to remove cookies or reject cookies, this could affect certain features or services of Websites online.

<a id="section_09" style="text-decoration:none"><h5>Controls for Do-Not-Track features</h5></a>
                <p>Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a Do-Not-Track ("DNT") feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your online browsing activities monitored and collected. At this stage, no uniform technology standard for recognizing and implementing DNT signals has been finalized. As such, Google Analytics, the data tracking service I use, does not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted that changes how Google Analytics honors this request in the future, I will follow that standard and revise this privacy notice. In the meantime, I can only assure that I do not personally willingly provide, store, collect, or distribute any personal identifying information for any of my users or clients to anyone without your consent.</p>
                
<a id="section_10" style="text-decoration:none"><h5>Do California residents have specific privacy rights?</h5></a>
                <p><strong>Plain language: </strong><i>Yes, if you are a resident of California, you are granted specific rights regarding access to your personal information. I personally try to comply with these standards for all of my users, even if they are not protected under California law as a resident of the state of California. I cannot guarantee my users who are not residents of California to be fully protected by these laws, but I still do my best to uphold them for the sake of privacy and fairness.</i></p>
                <p>California Civil Code Section 1798.83, also known as the "Shine The Light" law, permits my users who are California residents to request and obtain from me, once a year and free of charge, information about categories of personal information (if any) I disclosed to third parties for direct marketing purposes and the names and addresses of all third parties with which I shared personal information in the immediately preceding calendar year. If you are a California resident and would like to make such a request, please submit your request in writing to me using the contact information provided below.</p>
                <p>My Website does not store personal information. There are no account features and there are no ways for you to publically publish your own personal data on my Website. However, if you are under 18 years of age, reside in California, and have provided your personally identifiable information to me, you have the right to request removal and/or deletion of unwanted data that you have provided to me. To request removal and/or deletion of such data, please contact me using the contact information provided below, and include the email address associated with your personal information and a statement that you reside in California. I will make sure the data is not publicly displayed on the Website and delete it from any storage I have personal access to. Please be aware that the data may not be able to be completely or comprehensively removed from all my systems (e.g. backups, etc.).</p>
                <h6><span class="subheader">CCPA Privacy Notice</span></h6>
                <p>The California Code of Regulations defines a "resident" as:</p>

                <p>I believe everyone has a right to know how their personal data is being used in nearly every possible instance. And, in all reasonable circumstances, you have a right to know:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Whether I collect and use your personal information</li>
                  <li>The categories of personal information that I collect</li>
                  <li>The purposes for which the collected personal information is used</li>
                  <li>Whether I sell your personal information to third parties</li>
                  <li>The categories of personal information that may have been sold or disclosed for a business purpose</li>
                  <li>The categories of third parties to whom the personal information may have been sold or disclosed for a business purpose</li>
                  <li>The business or commercial purpose for collecting or selling personal information</li>
                </ul>
                <h6><span class="subheader">(3) Right to non-discrimination for the exercise of a consumer’s privacy rights</span></h6>
                <p>I do not and will not discriminate against you if you exercise your privacy rights.</p>
                <h6><span class="subheader">(4) Other privacy rights</span></h6>
                <ul>
                  <li>You may object to the processing of your personal data.</li>
                  <li>You may request correction of your personal data if it is incorrect or no longer relevant, or ask to restrict the processing of the data.</li>
                  <li>You can designate an authorized agent to make a request under the CCPA on your behalf. I may deny a request from an authorized agent that does not submit proof that they have been validly authorized to act on your behalf in accordance with the CCPA.</li>
                  <li>I do not sell personal information. However, in the case your information is sold by another party somewhere else online, you have the right to request to opt-out from future selling of your personal information to third parties. Upon receiving a request to opt-out, that party must act upon the request as soon as feasibly possible, but no later than 15 days from the date of the request submission.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>To exercise these rights, you can contact me by referring to the contact details at the bottom of this document. If you have a complaint about how I handle your data, I want to hear how I can help you.</p>
                <h6><span class="subheader">Data verification process</span></h6>
                <p>Upon receiving your request, I will need to verify your identity to determine you are the same person about whom I have the information. These verification efforts require me to ask you to provide information so that I can match it with information you have previously provided me. In order to verify your identity, I may contact you through a communication method (e.g. phone or email) that you have previously provided to me. I may also use other verification methods as the circumstances dictate.</p>
                <p>I will only use the personal information provided in your request to verify your identity or authority to make the request. To the extent possible, I will avoid requesting additional information from you for the purposes of verification. If, however, I cannot verify your identity from the information I already maintain, I may request that you provide additional information for the purposes of verifying your identity, and for security or fraud-prevention purposes. I will delete such additionally provided information as soon as I finish verifying you.</p>
